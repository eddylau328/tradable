				<p class="card-text text-black-50">Tradable is a web platform designed by 5 current CUHK students in conjunction with a team project for CSCI3100 Software Engineering, Spring 2019. Taking into consideration the vibrant and diverse environment of the CUHK campus, we believe that students can help each other settle in not only through verbal conversations but also through trading their unusable objects. We all know how hectic is the first move in on campus and this has made us think of an idea of how we can facilitate the process. On the other side, we also want to present an application to people who have been living with plenty of unusable objects and have realized that they might not need them anymore. Along with the numerous enquiries regarding second-hand books, which undoubtedly exist at every university around the world, it goes without saying that all the present means of technology can let us present a simple but (hopefully) valuable solution to everyone in need. Thus, we decided to present to our classmates and professors a new website, called Tradable, which is going to ensure that everyone on campus might get what they need as well as get rid of what they do not want.</p>
