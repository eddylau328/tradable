				<h5 class="card-text text-left">Overview:<h5>
				<p class="card-text text-black-50 text-left border-bottom pb-4">Tradable is a web application designed by 5 current CUHK students in conjunction with a team project for CSCI3100 Software Engineering, Spring 2019. Taking into consideration the vibrant and diverse environment of the CUHK campus, we believe that students can help each other settle in not only through verbal conversations but also through trading their unusable objects. We all know how hectic is the first move in on campus and this has made us think of an idea of how we can facilitate the process.<br>On the other side, we also want to present an application to people who have been living with plenty of unusable objects and have realized that they might not need them anymore. Along with the numerous enquiries regarding second-hand books, which undoubtedly exist at every university around the world, it goes without saying that all the present means of technology can let us present a simple but (hopefully) valuable solution to everyone in need.<br> Thus, we decided to present to our classmates and professors a new website, called Tradable, which is going to ensure that everyone on campus might get what they need as well as get rid of what they do not want.</p>
				<h5 class="card-text text-left">Scope:<h5>
				<p class="card-text text-black-50 text-left border-bottom pb-1">The purpose of our application is to provide an easily accessible web platform that facilitates the process of selling and/or buying used objects between CUHK staff and students. We are about to present a platform that will diminish the number of redundant possession at our student hostel and also will provide new opportunities to everyone on campus. Our website will let users obtain books, cutlery, etc. at a lower price and decent quality. The reason why we came up with this idea is the cost- and time-saving alternatives that most students are always trying to find. With this web platform, we want to reduce the time needed for doing the shopping when first-comers arrive, for instance, and let other students earn some profit from selling things they do not need anymore. In addition, we hope that Tradable will be beneficial to the growth of technological impact at our campus.</p>
